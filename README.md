# Master-project
Here you'll find the final codes for my master project in plasma and space physics

The main file uses the Sobel operator to find the gradient magnitude values, and it can find the orientation as well. Otsu's thresholding method is also integrate in this file, so one can see where the scintilaltions occur over the ASI images. 

Ori_mag_scint contains all the data, and plot_info.py is used to get all scatter plots and histograms. 

Ori_mag_scint_nullnull has no null values for the gradient manitude values to make it easier to plot the double-log scatter plots.
